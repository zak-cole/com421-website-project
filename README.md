In my website, I have a few different sections. I start with a header that gives my name and my current job. This helps to give the initial impression about who I am and what I do. This is also in bigger text, so that way it pops out more to the eye. I also have a navigation bar that is light blue, compared to the background of the rest which is light grey. This is to draw the eye's attention to it, since it has important extra information. For the sections of my resume, I have an objective, a skillset, my education, and my work experience. I also have a separate page for my projects. I separated my resume this way to try to highlight all of the important traits that I believed recruiters would look for. I separated projects onto another page so I would be able to add more in the future.

I wish I would have had more time to add more intricate details with the CSS on my website. I feel that the skills section and the objective section could have been combined side-by-side, which would have made the website look more visually appealing. I also wish that I could have included more information concerning my projects, such as images and demos. I also wish that I could have made the website itself more visually appealing, since as of right now, it just looks like a document with a grey background and black text.
